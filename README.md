# SI630 Project
 Assessing Humor in Edited News Headlines with LSTM

# Important notes
1. You need a ```GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin``` to run word2vec.
2. The top level is ```code_main.py```. You need to modify the argument before you run.
3. Folder ```intermediate_records``` saves some history and pickles.
    - ```record``` files are log
    - THEY ARE NOT THE OPTIMIZED MODEL!!!!!!! Because I forgot to save them...
